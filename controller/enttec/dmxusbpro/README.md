## Examples

### Write

Write DMX data using the serial device located at `COM5`.

  go run ./example/write/main.go --name=COM5

[Source](./example/write/main.go)

*Note: If testing with a specific fixture, make sure to adapt the example*

### Read

Read DMX data using the serial device located at `COM6`.

  go run ./example/read/main.go --name=COM6

[Source](./example/read/main.go)

## IN and OUT

DMX USB Pro has been designed to either receive or send a DMX stream at any one time, not both.

The DMX USB Proâ€™s input and output ports are physically connected to each other, therefore trying to recieve and send DMX streams would cause data degradation and flickering. Having the DMX IN and DMX OUT options it means that it can be integrated as part of a DMX chain when set to receive DMX data (in the same way you can daisy chain DMX in and out of a lighting fixture).
